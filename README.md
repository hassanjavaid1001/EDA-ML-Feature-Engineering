# EDA-ML-Feature-Engineering-

Welcome to My Kaggle Codes Repository! üëã
This repository is a collection of useful code and notebooks that will help you learn and grow in the field of data science and machine learning. It‚Äôs packed with practical examples, mini-projects, and real-world applications to help you master the key concepts.

üìÅ What You‚Äôll Find Inside
This repository is divided into several folders, each focused on an important part of data science:

1. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Learn how to explore your data effectively. This includes creating visualizations, summarizing key statistics, and preparing your data before applying models. EDA helps you understand the story your data is trying to tell.

2. Machine Learning Models
This section contains examples of different machine learning algorithms. You'll find both simple and advanced models, including:

Linear Regression

Decision Trees

Random Forest

Deep Learning, and more

Each notebook walks you through how the models work and how to apply them to real problems.

3. Feature Engineering
Good features improve model accuracy. In this section, you‚Äôll learn how to:

Select the most important features

Transform existing data

Create new meaningful features from raw data

4. Data Science Mathematics
Understand the math behind data science! This includes:

Linear Algebra

Probability & Statistics

Calculus basics
These topics are explained with examples and visualizations to make them easier to understand.

5. Miscellaneous
This folder includes other helpful code snippets, tools, and notebooks that cover a mix of topics related to data science.

üöÄ How to Use This Repository
Browse through the folders.

Open the Jupyter notebooks and read through the explanations and code.

Try running the code yourself to see how it works.

Use the examples to:

Learn new skills

Improve your Kaggle competition solutions

Build your own data science projects

Whether you're just starting out or already have experience, there's something here for everyone.
